# CS6230-CAD-FOR-VLSI---PROJECT 1 (MULTIPLY ACCUMULATE)

##A MAC operation, performed on 3 numbers A, B, and C, is formulated as shown below.
â€¢ MAC = A*B + C

##This has 2 different folders, each containing bluespec verilog code and cocotb testbench for 2 different data types:
##1. Non-pipelined MAC 
##2. Pipelined MAC 

## 2 different data types are:
##1. S1. (A: int8 , B: int8 , C: int32) -> (MAC: int32)
##2. S2. (A: bf16, B: bf16, C: fp32) -> (MAC: fp32)
